A lightweight Elementor widget to display YouTube, Vimeo, or MP4 videos in a customizable popup with overlay, play button, and aspect ratio control.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a powerful **Video Popup** widget to Elementor that allows you to:

- Embed **YouTube**, **Vimeo**, or direct **MP4** video links
- Open videos in a **custom popup** (no dependency on Elementor Lightbox)
- Upload a custom **thumbnail image** or use **SVG**
- Choose a **play button**: default icon, custom image, SVG, or none
- Adjust **play button size**
- Add a **permanent color overlay** on the thumbnail (with live preview in editor)
- Control **aspect ratio**: 16:9, 4:3, 1:1, 21:9, or custom
- Enable/disable popup mode (inline video fallback)
- Fully responsive and mobile-friendly

Perfect for portfolios, landing pages, and video showcases — without third-party lightbox libraries.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `custom-video-popup-elementor` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress.
3. Edit any page with Elementor and find the **"Video Popup"** widget under the **General** section.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work with YouTube, Vimeo, and MP4? =
Yes! Just paste the direct video URL (e.g., https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...).

= Why not use Elementor’s built-in video widget? =
This widget gives you full control over thumbnail, overlay, play button, and popup behavior — without relying on Elementor Lightbox, which may be disabled by your theme.

= Can I use my own play button image? =
Yes! You can upload a PNG, SVG, or JPG as your play button and adjust its size.

= Is it compatible with the latest Elementor? =
Yes. Tested with Elementor 3.20+ and WordPress 6.7.
